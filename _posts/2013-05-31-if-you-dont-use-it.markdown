...you lose it.  I know it's very cliche, and everyone knows it's true, but I'm going to reiterate it.  Because this "musings" sections is a place for my thoughts that don't belong on my [blog](http://1.6km.me).

I've only graduated a month ago, and it's already shocking me how much I'm forgetting from my earlier classes.  One of my friends came up to me and said "Pop quiz, what happens in this situation with an [AVL Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_Tree)?"  I didn't know.  Other than implementing it for class, I never really used it after that.

Mainly due to what my plans were for after graduation:

1. Go to the beach
2. Make side projects

The first part was easy, but coming up with side projects was difficult.  I wanted my side projects to reenforce what I had learned in school as well as teach me something new through the process.  I also wanted it to be somewhat practical, that was I'd be motivated to see it through to completion, unlike some of my [previous](https://github.com/kmwallio/KM-RayTracer) [projects](https://github.com/kmwallio/VideoTransformer) which I thought I was going to improve, but are now just showcase items in my history of programing because they started out as school projects[^fn-school-projects].

[^fn-school-projects]: I think it's fine to showcase school projects, and I truly was motivated to continue them at the time.  The issue I found was that when the class was done, they didn't fill a purpose for me.  I lost motivation.

So I decided that before I start a project, I should find a personal problem I have.  Then I should outline some tools I've learned that can help me with the project.  It would probably be good to pick some new stuff to learn and throw that in too.  I would then make the project.

The first problem that I decided to tackle was bookmarking.  Tools I've learned were PHP, SQL, and some machine learning.  The new items where [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) and decent site design with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap).  Thus [BookMark'd](https://github.com/kmwallio/BookMarkd) was born.

I have a list of some other problems I'd like to solve.  So I'm now deciding how I'll do them and the tools I'll use.

Anyways, this post was really just something to have the "musings" section not be empty.
