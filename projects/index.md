## [ThiefMD](https://thiefmd.com) (Vala)

[ThiefMD](https://thiefmd.com) is a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) editor inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). The code is forked from [Quilter](https://github.com/lainsce/quilter). It uses [iA Writer Duospace](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) as the font, and [Spledor](https://github.com/markdowncss/splendor) as the preview CSS.

This is the project I use to learn Vala along with trying to satisfy me missing certain applications from my Mac.

## [libwritegood](https://github.com/ThiefMD/libwritegood-vala) (Vala)

libwritegood is a port of [btford/write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) to Vala. Find passive voice, repeat words, long sentences, weak words, and other style checks.

libwritegood highlights problematic words, phrases, and sentences. Right-clicking on the highlighted words alerts the user of what libwritegood thinks can be improved.


## [Ulysses & GtkSourceView Theme Generator](https://github.com/ThiefMD/theme-generator) (Vala)

Keep your Markdown styles consistent between your editors, from macOS to Linux and even [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PL1J21XF0PT)?

Theme-Generator provides an interface for picking colors and customizing the way Markdown syntax is rendered. Users can create both a Light and Dark Theme, then export it into various formats. Ulthemes will work with [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) and [ThiefMD](https://thiefmd.com). [GtkSourceView Style Schemes](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/StyleSchemes) will work in gedit, and other editors built on [GtkSourceView](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView).

## [Acme::Skynet](https://github.com/kmwallio/Acme-Skynet) (Perl 6)

Acme::Skynet is toy intent identifier.  It attempts to extract "useful" information from a phrase and route that information to the proper subroutine.  Whether this works well or not is a completely different story.

Read the [blog post](http://1.6km.me/blog/2016/03/18/Determining-Intent-Pt-1/) for more.  Look at [the BasicIRCBot](https://github.com/kmwallio/BasicIRCBot) for an example.

## [BookMark'd](https://github.com/kmwallio/BookMarkd) (PHP)

BookMark'd saves links and makes them searchable.  BookMark's indexes pages you find interesting making them easier to access when you want to go back to them.

## [murderbear](murderbear.html) (Python)

murderBear was a group chat and video conferencing applications I worked on for my <a href="http://cs.fit.edu">college</a> <a href="http://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/classes/seniorProjects/">senior design project</a>.  Here's the [project video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0jYar8UGg).

## [Ray Tracer](raytracer.html) (Perl)

We were required to write a Ray Tracing program in our favorite language.  This is a small ray tracing script written in perl.

## [Video Transformer](videotransformer.html) (Perl)

In order to understand [projective transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation), we wrote applications that would read in user input on a sequence of video frames.  Based on the input, we would place another video on top of the original video.
