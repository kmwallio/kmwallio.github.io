## [Acme::Skynet](https://github.com/kmwallio/Acme-Skynet)

Acme::Skynet is toy intent identifier.  It attempts to extract "useful" information from a phrase and route that information to the proper subroutine.  Whether this works well or not is a completely different story.

## [Town and Country Raspberry Pi](http://carpi.miles-is.sexy)

*In Development*

A media client for my Town and Country.  It allows me to push content to the Raspberry Pi sitting in my car.  The Pi will automatically play music from a playlist I specify.  If other people are in the car, they can control the Pi using a web application.

## [BookMark'd](https://github.com/kmwallio/BookMarkd)

BookMark'd saves links and makes them searchable.  BookMark's indexes pages you find interesting making them easier to access when you want to go back to them.

## [murderbear](murderbear.html)

murderBear was a group chat and video conferencing applications I worked on for my <a href="http://cs.fit.edu">college</a> <a href="http://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/classes/seniorProjects/">senior design project</a>.  Here's the [project video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0jYar8UGg).

## [Ray Tracer](raytracer.html)

We were required to write a Ray Tracing program in our favorite language.  This is a small ray tracing script written in perl.

## [Video Transformer](videotransformer.html)

In order to understand [projective transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation), we wrote applications that would read in user input on a sequence of video frames.  Based on the input, we would place another video on top of the original video.
