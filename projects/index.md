## [murderbear](murderbear.html)

murderBear was a group chat and video conferencing applications I worked on for my <a href="http://cs.fit.edu">college</a> <a href="http://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/classes/seniorProjects/">senior design project</a>.  Here's the [project video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0jYar8UGg).

## [Ray Tracer](raytracer.html)

We were required to write a Ray Tracing program in our favorite language.  This is a small ray tracing script written in perl.

## [Video Transformer](videotransformer.html)

In order to understand [projective transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation), we wrote applications that would read in user input on a sequence of video frames.  Based on the input, we would place another video on top of the original video.
