## murderBear

[Project video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0jYar8UGg)

murderBear was a real-time collaboration web application. Users of murderBear were able to share thoughts, notes, files, illustrations, and even audio and video streams all in real-time. murderBear used Python, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and RTMP to connect it's users[^fn-websockets]. muderBear is not designed for project management but for aiding in communication in project collaboration.

[^fn-websockets]: Experimenting with Web Sockets and hoping the P2P aspects would be usable at the time were the main goal of this project.  We used the Tornado and Socket.io libraries.  RTMP was used for video communication in a flash applet.

## about the project (sales pitch)

murderBear is a real-time collaboration web application. Users of murderBear are able to share thoughts, notes, files, illustrations, and even audio and video streams all in real-time. murderBear uses the latest web technologies to connect collaborators digitally in real-time. muderBear is not designed for project management but for aiding in communication in project collaboration.

How does murderBear differ from other systems? Other systems require users to install software or limit users to text, audio, and/or video chat. There are more methods and mediums of communication out there, and murderBear brings some of those mediums to its users. murderBear provides traditional text, audio, and video chat, and murderBear also provides a real- time canvas and file sharing. Using the latest web technologies, murderBear requires only the users' web browser with no additional software installation.

Imagine this: You need to study with friends, but a hurricane has struck preventing any member of your group from being able to make it to your planned physical meeting place. How are you supposed to hold your group meeting? murderBear will be an online application allowing all the members of your group who have access to a computer and the Internet to meet digitally.

murderBear was our senior design project for [CSE 4101](http://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/classes/seniorProjects/)
