## [Ray Tracer](https://github.com/kmwallio/KM-RayTracer)

This is an example Ray Tracing program written in Perl. It was produced for CSE 4280: Graphics Algorithms. Ray Tracing is a way of generating an image by following a ray through an image plane and calculating a color from objects and light sources. One can generate what appears to be a 3-D image from different mathematical equations for representing 3-D Objects in space. For more on ray tracing, feel free to read the page on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)). The code is available for viewing and for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/kmwallio/KM-RayTracer).

## About the Program

This program demonstrates ray tracing. It is written in Perl for CSE 4280: Graphics Algorithms. The program takes several points for different objects, calculates their locations and colors, and then writes the file out to the PPM format.
